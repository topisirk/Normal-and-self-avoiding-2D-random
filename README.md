# Normal and self-avoiding 2D random walks using fortran in the contest of a drunken sailor problem for a final project in a Scientific computing course. The run and src folders both have their own README files inside with instructions. Description of statistics for n randomwalks is included in output.dat inside the run folder. Easy visualization of single random walks was not a part of the project but would be a nice implementation possibly in the future.
