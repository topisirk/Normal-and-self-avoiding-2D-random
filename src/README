To compile with gfortran, use 'gfortran -c stat.f90 mtfort.f90 sailor.f90' on the command line, while being in the right directory (src). After this is done, you can link the files using 'gfortran sailor.o stat.o mtfort90.o'. It's important that in compilation sailor.f90 is the last file in the list. For example,

topisirk@lx7-fuxi191:/home/local/topisirk/Desktop/Tila2/sirkia_topi_sc2_project4/tempname/src$ gfortran -c stat.f90 mtfort90.f90 sailor.f90
topisirk@lx7-fuxi191:/home/local/topisirk/Desktop/Tila2/sirkia_topi_sc2_project4/tempname/src$ gfortran sailor.o stat.o mtfort90.o

The program is now ready to be run.

To run, use ./a.out along with 3 parameters. The parameters are n (number of walks), yes/no (trajectories to textfiles? can take alot of space for more than a few thousand walks as the walks are quite long)
and lastly nrw/saw (normal or self-avoiding walks). For example

topisirk@lx7-fuxi191:/home/local/topisirk/Desktop/Tila2/sirkia_topi_sc2_project4/tempname/src$ ./a.out 5000 yes saw

The running time can vary a lot depending on the parameters, but 1000 saw walks with trajectories to text files took me 35s.
